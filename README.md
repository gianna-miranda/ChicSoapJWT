This project is a website made for my mother, Gilla Miranda.
THe set up of thsi website is fairly simple in my src folder I decided to have 2 folders. 'Core' which is where you will find our NavBar and Footer. 'Feature' which is where you will find our pages components that we will import onto our 'Pages' folder. This set up seemed cleaner to me and it also allowed me to change the order of the components whithout having to change any code. 

What did we use?

What were our challenges?
Some of the challenges I encountered was making my footer stay at the bottom, for some reason it only works if in my ComingCoon.scss I include a height of 1300px. My biggest challenge was creating my dnv, most of time was spent on this because I kept changing how many tables I wanted and how specific I wanted to make it s
Breif description of process :













<!-- ******My Project Crashing- Gianna Miranda
My project crashed this morning, it started off as a sass error, but then "Element type is invalid" Kept showing up on the screen along with a message saying "25 stack frames were collapsed". At this point I was freaking out.(you can find a screenshot of this image in my image folder 'public/image/newError.png'). I am not sure what I did for that error to show up. 
***Challenge: (what does collapsed mean? what does that error mean? how to fix it?)

At this point I turned to github to go back to when it was working, which I hadent done yet. The only push I had made was my skeleton. I used my broken code and my skeleton code to make this code. It is not my best I will be the first to admit it. I am very proud of this website, front end was more of a challenge for me and being able to put this together so quick was a great feeling. A feeling of success overcome by the nervousness/ emberacement of presenting this website incomplete. I will be refactoring this website until it is what I had invisioned it to be. -->
